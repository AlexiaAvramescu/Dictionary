# Interactive Dictionary Application

## Description
This project is a dynamic dictionary application developed using C# and WPF (.NET Framework). The application comprises three primary modules: Administrative, Word Search, and Entertainment.

## Modules

### Administrative Module
The Administrative module enables users to manage the dictionary by adding, modifying, or deleting words and their associated descriptions. Each word includes a description and a category, with the option to upload an image. Users can select existing categories or create new ones. Images are uploaded from the local machine and stored within the application's resource area.

### Word Search Module
The Word Search module allows users to search for words based on specific categories or without category restrictions. Utilizing an autocomplete mechanism, users can efficiently find desired words. Upon selecting a word from the search results, its description, category, and associated image are displayed. If no image is associated with a word, a default image is shown.

### Entertainment Module
The Entertainment module offers a word-guessing game where users are challenged to guess five words from the dictionary. Each word is randomly selected, and users are provided with either the description or an image (if available) as a clue. After each guess, users can navigate to the next word. Upon reaching the fifth word, the "Next" button changes to "Finish," indicating the end of the game. Feedback on the correctness of each guess is provided, with correct answers revealed after each word.

## Key Features

- User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.
- Dynamic word search functionality with autocomplete.
- Interactive word-guessing game for entertainment and learning.
